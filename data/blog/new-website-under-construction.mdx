# Welcome to my new website! Well, sort of.

Welcome to my new website! Although it isn't quite finished yet, the idea is this
website is a space for me to broadcast my ideas, projects, and music in one location
for people to see. It's great for marketing what I've done, which is also a good bonus.
With that being said, let's talk a little bit about what to expect from this website.

## Why does this exist?

There were several reasons I decided to start working on my own website. For starters,
as a Computer Engineer I feel like it's a little embarrasing for me to _not_ have a website.
Web development is a pretty crucial part of my education (and, potentially, my job) so I
figured it was a good idea to have something to show for that. I also wanted a space for people
to be able to keep up with what's going on in my life. Whether I have new projects I'm working on
(coding or not), music that I'm releasing, etc. I want all of these things to be available.

## Content

So, reasons and introductions aside, let's dive into what to expect content-wise.
As of right now, my website is going to have the following:

- [Projects](https://siraius.vercel.app/projects) I'm working on
- Music that I've released or plan on releasing (_page is a work in progress_)
- This [blog](https://siriaus.vercel.app/blog) detailing what's going on in my life
- My Resume
- Links to all my social media and important pages

Keep checking in to see the development of the website! I'm excited to get to work!
